# What is perspective? It’s basically the feature that things that are further away appear smaller.


###  Z is 1
\[
    10 / 1 = 10 \\
    20 / 1 = 20 \\
    abs(10-20) = 10
\]

###  Z is 2
\[
    10 / 2 = 5 \\
    20 / 2 = 10 \\
    abs(5-10) = 5
\]


###  Z is 3
\[
    10 / 3 = 3.333 \\
    20 / 3 = 6.666 \\
    abs(3.333-6.666) = 3.333
\]

# What “Perspective” Actually Means in 3D Graphics

In real life:
- Objects that are far away look smaller.
- Parallel lines (like railway tracks) appear to meet at the horizon.

A perspective projection is the mathematical trick that makes exactly that happen on a flat screen.

Without perspective → everything stays the same size no matter how far it is (orthographic, like a 2D game or CAD program).

ith perspective → far = smaller + correct convergence → feels 3D.
