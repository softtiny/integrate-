- Key Considerations
    - Separation by Purpose:
        - Group workflows by their purpose (e.g., CI, CD, utilities, schedules).
        - ach YAML file should handle a specific task or set of related jobs (e.g., build.yml for building, test.yml for testing).
    - Reusable Workflows:
        - Use reusable workflows to avoid duplicating code. For example, create a setup.yml in utils/ that other workflows can call using the workflow_call trigger.

#### Example,Call it in another workflow.


```yaml
# .github/workflows/utils/setup.yml
name: Setup Environment
on:
  workflow_call:
jobs:
  setup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
```
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci/build.yml
name: Build
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  setup:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/utils/setup.yml
  build:
    needs: setup
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm run build
```
